### [Diff Two Arrays](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/diff-two-arrays)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Check two arrays and return a new array that contains only the items that are not in either of the original arrays.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
Merge the list to make it easy to compare functions.

### Hint 2
Use filter to get the new array, you will need to create a callback function.

### Hint 3
The best way to go about the callback function is to check if the number from the new merged array is not in **both** original arrays and return it.
